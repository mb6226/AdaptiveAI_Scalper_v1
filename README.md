# AdaptiveAI_Scalper_v1

## Overview
AdaptiveAI_Scalper_v1 is an advanced Expert Advisor (EA) for MetaTrader 5 that uses adaptive, AI-driven scalping strategies.  
The EA is modular, extensible, and designed for efficient, rule-based trading on Forex pairs.

---

## Features
- Adaptive trading logic based on market data
- Modular design for easier maintenance and extension
- Real-time signal analysis and trade management
- Risk management integrated

---

## Project Structure
The project is organized into modules for clarity and maintainability:
- `MarketData.mqh` — handles market indicators and price data fetching
- `SignalAnalyzer.mqh` — analyzes trading signals based on indicators
- `TradeManager.mqh` — executes trades and manages orders
- `RiskManager.mqh` — monitors equity and manages risk limits
- `AdaptiveAI_Scalper_v1.mq5` — main EA file integrating all modules

---

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
- MetaTrader 5 platform installed
- Basic understanding of MQL5 programming and MetaEditor
- Git (optional) for version control

### How to Build
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `AdaptiveAI_Scalper_v1.mq5` in MetaEditor.
3. Compile the EA and fix any compile errors if they appear.
4. Attach the EA to the desired chart in MetaTrader 5.
5. Configure input parameters as needed and start live or demo testing.

## Development Notes

- The project uses native MQL5 indicator handles (e.g., `iMA`, `iBands`) with correct buffer management.
- The code is written modularly to allow isolated testing of components.
- Errors and warnings have been minimized via iterative debugging and improvements.
- GitHub Issues and Pull Requests can be used for collaboration and version tracking.

# AdaptiveAI_Scalper_v1

## Project Overview
AdaptiveAI_Scalper_v1 is a modular, AI-driven scalping Expert Advisor (EA) designed for MetaTrader 5. The goal is to combine rule-based trading logic with machine learning models for smarter decision-making and adaptive risk management.

---

## Development Plan

### Step 1️⃣: EA Testing and Optimization
- Run the EA with all designed modules (scoring entry, adaptive SL/TP, trailing stops, break-even, time/news filters, cooldowns, etc.)
- Perform precise backtests on historical data and demo account tests
- Review dashboard outputs, signals, and risk management
- Apply necessary improvements and bug fixes

### Step 2️⃣: Data Collection and Storage
- Save price data, indicators, and EA signals (e.g., CSV file) on every tick
- Log trade results (entries, exits, P/L) for accurate AI training
- Prepare datasets for machine learning model training

### Step 3️⃣: Machine Learning Model Training (Outside MetaTrader)
- Analyze data and train simple ML models (regression, decision trees, simple neural networks)
- Evaluate model accuracy on new data
- Output model predictions as signals or probabilities

### Step 4️⃣: Signal File Format Design for EA Input
- Create CSV or JSON files containing timestamp, signal type, and signal strength
- Develop EA code to read and update signals from these files

### Step 5️⃣: Integrate ML Logic with EA Scoring System
- Combine ML model signals with rule-based scoring logic
- Assign weights or combined thresholds for trade entries
- Test and optimize decision-making performance

### Step 6️⃣: Real-Time EA Connection to ML Model (Optional, Advanced)
- Establish communication between EA and ML program via DLL or API
- Receive live signals with low latency
- Ensure security and stability of connection

### Step 7️⃣: Continuous Improvement and Development
- Add more filters (news, volume, candlestick patterns)
- Implement online learning for adaptive models
- Automate advanced analytics and reporting
- Improve intelligent risk management

## How to Get Started

Choose your current focus step and start implementing:

- Step 1: Optimize and test the current EA
- Step 2: Implement data collection in EA
- Step 3: Train ML model externally
- Step 4: Design signal file format and read signals in EA
- … and so on.

Feel free to ask questions anytime — this roadmap will guide you to build the AdaptiveAI_Scalper_v1 step by step.

## Notes
- The project is modular for easy maintenance and future expansion.
- Use GitHub for version control.
- Markdown used for documentation for clear formatting and easy updates.
- Always test modules individually before full integration.
