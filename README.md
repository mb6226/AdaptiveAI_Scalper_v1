## âœ… Project Goals

- Build a reliable and rule-driven scalping system in MQL5
- Use dynamic scoring logic from RSI, EMA, ATR, and Bollinger Bands
- Implement solid risk control (equity guard, time filters, news filter)
- Enable backtest optimization with tunable input weights
- Prepare base logic for AI-enhanced decision-making
