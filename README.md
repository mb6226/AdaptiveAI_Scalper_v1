# Adaptive AI-Driven Scalper v1

## Project Overview
Adaptive AI-Driven Scalper v1 is an advanced trading algorithm for smart scalping using adaptive AI-based strategies and rule-based logic. This bot integrates several strategies like adaptive trailing stop, break-even management, news filtering, and much more.

### Key Features
- **MarketData Module**: Handles all market data retrieval including RSI, ATR, EMA, and Bollinger Bands.
- **SignalAnalyzer Module**: Generates buy/sell signals based on market data and various technical indicators.
- **TradeManager Module**: Responsible for executing trades, including stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop logic.
- **RiskManager Module**: Manages risk by monitoring equity, time-based filters, and news-based filters.
- **Dashboard Module**: Displays the status of the system and logs on the chart for easy monitoring.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mb6226/AdaptiveAI_Scalper_v1.git
Open MetaEditor and load the AdaptiveAI_Scalper_v1.mq5 file.

Compile the EA in MetaEditor to ensure there are no compilation errors.

Test the EA in MetaTrader 5 using a demo account before running it on a live account.

Usage
Input Parameters:

Lots: Trade size (default: 0.1)

Slippage: Maximum allowable slippage (default: 3)

ATR_SL_Multiplier: ATR multiplier for stop loss calculation (default: 1.0)

ATR_TP_Multiplier: ATR multiplier for take profit calculation (default: 1.5)

RSI_Period: Period for RSI indicator (default: 14)

TradeStartHour: Hour to start trading (default: 8)

TradeEndHour: Hour to stop trading (default: 18)

And more...

Main Logic:
The bot will place trades based on signals generated by technical indicators such as RSI, ATR, and EMA. It includes additional features such as trailing stop and break-even to optimize the performance.

Testing
Unit tests for each module (MarketData, SignalAnalyzer, TradeManager, and RiskManager) are located in the /Tests directory. You can run them to verify the correctness of each module.

Complete Implementation of Adaptive AI-Driven Scalper
Phase 1️⃣: Full Testing and Optimization of Current EA
Run the bot with all modules we've designed (score entry, adaptive SL/TP, trailing, break-even, time and news filtering, cooldown, etc.)

Perform accurate backtesting on live data and demo account testing.

Evaluate output of dashboard, signals, and risk management.

Apply necessary fixes and improvements.

Phase 2️⃣: Data Collection and Storage
Save price data, indicators, and bot signals (e.g., in a CSV file) on every tick.

Store trade results (entries, exits, profits/losses) for accurate training of the AI model.

Prepare the data for training.

Phase 3️⃣: Machine Learning Model Training (Outside MetaTrader)
Analyze data and train a simple ML model (regression, decision trees, simple neural networks).

Evaluate model accuracy with new data.

Output model as a signal or entry probability.

Phase 4️⃣: Design Signal File Template for EA Input
Create a CSV or JSON file that contains time, signal type, and signal strength.

Implement code inside the EA to read and update signals.

Phase 5️⃣: Combine ML Logic with EA Scoring System
Combine ML signals with rule-based scoring logic (e.g., weighting).

Set threshold conditions for entry.

Test and optimize decision-making.

Phase 6️⃣: Real-Time EA to ML Model Integration (Optional)
Connect the EA to a Python program or ML service via DLL or API.

Fetch live signals and make fast responses.

Ensure security and performance.

Phase 7️⃣: Continuous Improvement and Development
Add more filters (news, volume, candlestick patterns).

Implement online learning (continuous model training).

Smarter risk management.

Advanced automatic analysis and reporting.

Let's Get Started:
If you're ready, we can start with Phase 1: Design the ML Signal CSV Template and write the EA code for reading it.

Or we can go straight to Phase 2: Data collection within the EA.

Feel free to ask any questions or jump to any phase you'd like to begin with!
