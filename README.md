# Adaptive AI-Driven Scalper v1

## Overview

Adaptive AI-Driven Scalper v1 is an advanced expert advisor (EA) designed for MetaTrader 5 that combines traditional rule-based trading strategies with machine learning signals to enhance trading performance. The strategy includes multiple modules for market data processing, signal analysis, trade management, and risk control.

## Project Roadmap

### Step 1: EA Testing and Optimization  
- Run the EA with all designed modules (scoring entry, adaptive SL/TP, trailing, break-even, news/time filters, cooldowns, etc.)  
- Perform detailed backtesting on real data and demo account testing  
- Review dashboard outputs, signals, and risk management  
- Apply necessary corrections and improvements  

### Step 2: Data Collection and Storage  
- Save price data, indicators, and EA signals (e.g., in CSV files) at every tick  
- Record trade results (entries, exits, P/L) for ML training  
- Prepare datasets for model training  

### Step 3: ML Model Training Outside MT5 (e.g., Python)  
- Analyze data and train simple ML models (regression, decision trees, simple neural networks)  
- Evaluate model accuracy on new data  
- Output signals as entry probabilities  

### Step 4: Signal File Format Design for EA Input  
- Create CSV or JSON files containing timestamp, signal type, and strength  
- Develop EA code to read and update signals from these files  

### Step 5: Combine ML Logic with EA Scoring System  
- Merge ML signals with rule-based scoring  
- Weight or condition combined entries  
- Test and optimize decision making  

### Step 6: Real-Time EA Connection to ML Model (Optional/Advanced)  
- Connect EA to Python app or ML service via DLL or API  
- Receive live signals with low latency  
- Manage security and performance  

### Step 7: Continuous Improvement and Expansion  
- Add more filters (news, volume, candlestick patterns)  
- Implement online learning  
- Automate reporting and analysis  
- Enhance risk management
